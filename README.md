# pytorch-human-performance-gec

The goal of this project is to implement a grammatical error correction model from paper ["Reaching Human-level Performance in Automatic Grammatical Error Correction: An Empirical Study"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01270) using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq).

While the original paper achieves human performance, this implementation is more about an empirical study on applying deep learning in NLP as a university team project.

## Project Team

This project was completed as the final project for CS 410: Text Information Systems at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The team members and their primary areas of responsibility were:

* Tianfei Chen: left-to-right model construction and training, GLEU scoring function, evaluation of test sets, inference, boost inference, web GUI, documentation, and project presentation.
* Robert Cottrell: framework evaluation and selection, organizing project structure and dependencies, initial prototyping and documentation, boost learning, fluency scoring, and project presentation.
* Lenny Giannachi: research datasets, acquire alternative datasets, and technology review.
* Jingwei Li: BPE tokenization, research alignment dictionary generation.
* Jonathan Montwell: research datasets, right-to-left data generation, technology review.

A [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_BHr5RyVdA) is available online and the (slides)[Project-Presentation.pdf] are included in this repository.

## What We Learned

### Empirical Study

- Write code quickly
  - Use a framework
    - Don't start from scratch. Use existing library, framework and toolkit.
    - Pre-processing, batching, checkpointing, common models are all included.
    - Tried both OpenNMT and fairseq NLP toolkits.
    - Settled with fairseq which is also what paper used.
  - It is ok to just copy toolkit and components then modify them
    - This is officially recommended way to extending and playing with fairseq.
    - When you copy many times you will naturally learn how to refactor them later.
- Run experiments
  - Run out of box samples to learn how toolkit works.
  - Run simple models to get a proof of concept and confidence.
- Keep track of what you tried
  - Keep track of what you ran
    - Source control constructed models and hyper-paramters.
    - Save the scripts so that you can repeat them again with other tweaks and datasets.
  - Keep track of what you got
    - Many frameworks and toolkits will do this for you automatically.
    - Just need to keep folders clear and watch your hard drive free space.
- Analyze model behavior
  - Feed model with some simplest tests
    - Look at generated values see if that's what you expected.
    - Look at scores and see if they make sense.
  - Evaluate models with proper evaluation metric
    - Loss function for training.
    - Fluency score (cross entropy) and GLEU score etc.

### Completed

- A left-to-right 7-layer convolutional seq2seq model has been implemented using same architecture as the paper suggested.
- The base convolutional seq2seq model has been trained using mostly same hyper parameters.
- Fluency score function, which is used for both boost training / learning and boost inference, has been implemented. For example, nature sentences get higher score.

```
- GLEU score function, which is used to evaluate JFLEG test set, has been implemented. For example, similar sentences have higher GLEU score.

- Evaluation of JFLEG test set using GLEU score.
  - The base model has a GLEU score 48.17 on JFLEG test set when it was trained for 2 epochs.
  - The base model has a GLEU score 48.89 on JFLEG test set when it was trained for 3 epochs.
  - The introduction of boost inference increased GLEU from 48.89 to 49.39. The percentage of increase is consistent with the paper ( â‰ˆ 1% ).

### Not Completed

- A right-to-left convolutional seq2seq model.
- Training of the model using new dataset generated by boost learning.
- BPE tokenization and unknown token replacement.
- Stemming for raw text / interactive modes.
- Evaluation of CoNLL-10 test set using F0.5.

### Barriers

- No enough training dataset: we got only Lang-8 corpus, which is about 20% of the dataset used by the paper. We've tried to contact other organizations, but no response was received.
- Limit time: training big neural network model with large dictionaries is time consuming. We decided to complete the whole process instead of trying to reproduce the score achieved by the paper. We can probably achieve it given more time and datasets.

## Initialize Submodules

After checking out the repository, be sure to initialize the included git submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The reasons of using them as submodules rather than Python package are:
* some scripts and functions might need be patched in order to work properly.
* a few scripts are modified based on the original scripts, which is the officially recommended way of using fairseq.

## Install Required Dependencies

The environment used for the development is Windows 10 64bit + Python 3.6 + CUDA 9.2 + pytorch 0.4.1.

`PyTorch` can be installed by following the directions on its [project page](https://pytorch.org). Conda is recommended as it will install CUDA dependencies automatically. For example,

```sh
conda install pytorch cuda92 -c pytorch
pip3 install torchvision
```

This project also uses the `fairseq` NLP toolkit, which is included as a submodule in this repository. To prepare the library for use, make sure that it is installed along with its dependencies.

```sh
cd fairseq
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build develop
```

Other project dependencies are placed under `fairseq-scripts` folder, which can be installed by running

```sh
cd fairseq-scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## fairseq Custom Scripts / Software Usage Tutorial

All fairseq scripts have been grouped under `fairseq-scripts` folder. The whole process is:

1. Preparing data
2. Pre-process data
3. Train the model
4. Testing the model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Interactive mode
7. Boosting

### Preparing Data

The first step is to prepare the source and target pairs of training and validation data. Extract original `lang-8-en-1.0.zip` under `corpus` folder. Then create another folder `lang-8-fairseq` under `corpus` folder to store re-formatted corpus.

To split the Lang-8 learner data training set, use the following command:

```sh
python transform-lang8.py -src_dir <dataset-src> -out_dir <corpus-dir>
```
e.g.
```sh
python transform-lang8.py -src_dir ../corpus/lang-8-en-1.0 -out_dir ../corpus/lang-8-fairseq
```

### Pre-process Data

Once the data has been extracted from the dataset, use fairseq to prepare the training and validation data and create the vocabulary:

```sh
preprocess-lang8.bat
```

### Train the Model

To train the error-correcting model, run the following command:

```sh
train-lang8-cnn.bat
```

Note that this script may need to be adjusted based on the GPU and memory resources available for training.

### Testing the Model

To test the model, run the following command to try to correct a list of sentences:

```sh
generate-lang8-cnn.bat
```

This command will try to correct all sentences in a file with probabilities and scores in the output. It is a convenient way to peed that the model behaves as expected against lots of test data.

### Evaluate the Model

Evaluate scripts are used to score model using text or pre-processed files in batch.

Evaluate can be done against lang-8 test dataset using

```sh
generate-lang8-cnn-rawtext.bat
```

The paper evaluates against JFLEG test dataset, which can be done using

```sh
generate-jfleg-cnn-rawtext.bat
```

Above scripts can be modified to test other test dataset easily as they use plain text.

Other scripts such as `generate-lang8.bat or generate-lang8-cnn.bat` can only deal with pre-processed data so it is less convenient.

### Interactive Mode

While evaluate scripts are good at batch processing, two interactive scripts are provided to see details of generation / correction.

Below script will run in console mode:
```sh
interactive-lang8-cnn-console.bat
```

Below script will boot a local server to provide a web GUI and RESTful API interface:
```sh
interactive-lang8-cnn-web.bat
```

Interactive mode allows users to enter a sentence in console, or Web GUI, to see how subtle difference in input are corrected.

### Boosting

To augment training data to provide more examples of common errors, this project builds an error-generating model that can produce additional lower quality sentences for correct sentences. This uses the same training data as the regular model, but reverses the source and target sentences.

Once the data has been extracted from the dataset, use fairseq to prepare the training and validation data and create the vocabulary:

```sh
preprocess-errorgen.bat
```

To train the error-correcting model, run the following command:

```sh
train-errorgen-cnn.bat
```

Note that this script may need to be adjusted based on the GPU and memory resources available for training.

Now the error-generating model can be use to generate additional training data. The generating script will only consider sentences longer than four words that are at least 5% less fluent (as measured by the fluency scorer) than the corrected sentences. This ensures that the new sentences are more likely to showcase interesting corrections while avoiding trivial edits. Notice that in this case we use the latest model checkpoint rather than the most generalized, because in this particular case overfitting to the training data is an advantage!

```sh
generate-errorgen-cnn.bat
```

The sentences generated in the corpus\errorgen directory can then be used as additional data to train or fine tune the error-correcting model.

### Additional Techniques

In addition to the work describe above, additional datasets and techniques for data preprocessing, model training, and other imporovements were evaluated.

BPE tokenization promises to make more effective use of a limited number of vocabulary tokens by further subdividing words into subword tokens that can be shared by many different words. A Jupyter [notebook](BPEtokenization-scripts/SubwordNMT.ipynb) showing how to install and tokenize the dataset is available in the [BPEtokenization-scripts](BPEtokenization-scripts/) directory.

An example of sentences after apply BPE tokenization can be seen below:
```
I will introduce my dog , Ti@@ ara .
She is a cheerful and plu@@ mp pretty dog , perhaps she is the cu@@ test dog in the world .
She 's an 8 year old golden re@@ tri@@ ever
Her fu@@ r is a beautiful a@@ mber colour and is soft .
She is a little stupid , but has per@@ cep@@ tive insi@@ ghts about food because she is always fami@@ shed ^ ^ She loves food !
When she has had her food , she always pr@@ ances around the living room mer@@ ri@@ ly .
And she loves ba@@ s@@ king too .
```

### Patching fairseq Environment

If error `AttributeError: function 'bleu_zero_init' not found` occurs on Windows, modify functions to have `__declspec(dllexport)` then build again. See [Issue 292](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/292)

If error `UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte` error occurs, modify `fairseq/tokenizer.py` to include `, encoding='utf8'` for all `open` functions.

When trying built-in example from `fairseq/examples/translation/prepare-[dataset].sh`, scripts may need to change .py path from `$BPEROOT/[script].py` to `$BPEROOT/subword_nmt/[script].py`.


## OpenNMT Scripts (Legacy)

All OpenNMT scripts have been grouped under `opennmt-scripts` folder.

### Preparing Data

The first step is to prepare the source and target pairs of training and validation data. Extract original `lang-8-en-1.0.zip` under `corpus` folder. Then create another folder `lang-8-opennmt` under `corpus` folder to store re-formatted corpus.

To split the Lang-8 learner data training set, use the following command:

```sh
python transform-lang8.py -src_dir <dataset-src> -out_dir <corpus-dir>
```
e.g.
```sh
python transform-lang8.py -src_dir ../corpus/lang-8-en-1.0 -out_dir ../corpus/lang-8-opennmt
```

Once the data has been extracted from the dataset, use OpenNMT to prepare the training and validation data and create the vocabulary:

```sh
preprocess-lang8.bat
```

### Train the Model

To train the error-correcting model, run the following command:

```sh
train.bat
```

Note that this script may need to be adjusted based on the GPU and memory resources available for training.

### Testing the Model

To test the model, run the following command to try to correct a list of sentences:

```sh
translate.bat
```

After the sentences have been translated, the source and target sentence may be compared side to side using the following command:

```sh
python compare.py
```

### Patching OpenNMT-py Environment

If `preprocess.py` fails with a TypeError, then you may need to patch OpenNMT-py.

Update `OpenNMT-py\onmt\inputters\dataset_base.py` with the following code:

```python
def __reduce_ex__(self, proto):
    "This is a hack. Something is broken with torch pickle."
    return super(DatasetBase, self).__reduce_ex__(proto)
```

If `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'dtype'` occurs, `pytorch/text` installed by pip may be out of date. Update it using `pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/text`

If `RuntimeError: CuDNN error: CUDNN_STATUS_SUCCESS` occurs during training, try install pytorch with CUDA 9.2 using conda instead of using default CUDA 9.0.
